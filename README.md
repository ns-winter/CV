A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner
TBD...

#### Communication

During my years as a Consular Officer, I offered bilingual assistance to clients seeking to use the consular services of the Maltese High Commission.  This took place via email, phone, and face-to-face. Because of the client-facing nature of the role, it was essential that not only was my written and verbal communication clear and helpful, but also that my non-verbal communication and demeanour be professional and friendly, in order to effectively establish rapport with individuals from different backgrounds and cultures.

#### Delivery

As the officer in charge of the Passports Section, I was responsible for the management of client appointments and ensuring that their passports were issued within an appropriate timeframe. During my first full year at the High Commission, I increased the total issuance rate on passports by 10% (and set the record for total issuances in a calendar year) and during the entirety of my period there, I succeeded in delivering 100% of all passports to applicants within the required timeframe.
